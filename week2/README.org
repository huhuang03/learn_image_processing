* Big picture
Image -> Construct n x n subImages -> Forward transform -> Quantizer -> Symbol encoder -> Compressed Image
Compressed Image -> Symbol decoder -> Inverse transform -> Merge nxn sub images -> Decompressed image

* Goal
After learn, I want to load an bmp image, and save it as jpg_demo(which do much like jpg compress) and then
reload and show in ~cv::imshow~. It's a big project. Come on!!

Jump for now, because I think it's hard to me, if I can't go on because this. I will go back to see again.
